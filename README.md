Java is an object-oriented and high-level programming language that was created in the middle of the 1990s by Sun Microsystems, which is now owned by Oracle. It is one of the most popular languages in the world, it is famous because of its durability, performance, and portability.
Java follows the "Write Once, Run Anywhere" philosophy which can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.
There are multiple of real life scenarios where we can use java
•	Enterprise applications (e.g., banking systems)
•	Mobile apps (Android development)
•	Web applications (using Java EE and frameworks like Spring)
•	Desktop applications
•	Big data tools (e.g., Apache Hadoop)
Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the process of restricting direct access to an object's data and methods by bundling them within a class. It is used for access modifiers like private, protected, and public to control access to the class’s data. 
 Encapsulation is used because it Protects the data from unauthorized access.
Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details of an object and showing only the necessary features. In Java, abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.
•	Abstract class is a class that cannot be represented but can be subclassed. It may contain abstract methods (methods without a body) and non-abstract methods (with a body).
•	Interface is  a reference type, like a class, that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, and static methods.
Polymorphism is one of the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). it allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. 
Polymorphism enables method overriding and method overloading for that it provides flexibility and reusability in code.
Types of Polymorphism in Java
There are two main types of polymorphism in Java:
1.	Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Binding / Method Overloading)
2.	Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Binding / Method Overriding)

The Java Collections Framework (JCF) is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections in Java. It provides a set of interfaces, implementations, and algorithms to handle collections. Collections are used to store, retrieve, manipulate, and communicate data in Java.
• List: An ordered collection (sometimes called a sequence). Elements can be inserted or accessed by their position (index).
• Set: it is a collection that does not allow duplicate elements.
• Queue: A collection designed for holding elements prior to processing (e.g., FIFO behaviour).
• Map: An object that maps keys to values. Unlike other collections, a map does not extend the Collection interface.
Exception handling is a mechanism in Java that allows the programmer to handle runtime errors, thus preventing the program from crashing. 
When an exception occurs, the program will terminate unless we handle it. Exception handling provides a way to catch errors, allowing our program to continue running , instead of crashing unexpectedly.
• Java provides a powerful mechanism to handle exceptions through try, catch, finally, and throw blocks.
Try Block:  In this block we place the code that might throw an exception. 
Catch Block: If an exception occurs inside the try block, the catch block handles it. It catches the exception and allows us to decide how to deal with it.
• Finally Block: This block is optional, but it’s used to execute code that must run, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. 
• Throw: This keyword allows us to throw an exception from a method or block of code when something goes wrong.
• Throws: The throws keyword is used in a method signature to declare that the method might throw certain types of exceptions.
Conclusion
Java is a powerful and versatile programming language that continues to be a cornerstone of modern software development. 
Its strong emphasis on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles ensures clean, reusable, and maintainable code, 
while its platform independence through the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) allows applications to run seamlessly across different systems. 
With an extensive set of built-in libraries and frameworks, Java is well-suited for a wide range of applications, from enterprise-level systems to mobile apps and web services. As a result, 
Java remains a go-to choice for developers seeking scalability, reliability, and flexibility in their software solutions.
